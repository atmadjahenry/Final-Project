Final Project Bank Loan Approval

This data is from Kaggle, Bank Loan Status Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset). 
This dataset has 100514 rows and 18 columns.


Project Description
------------
Bank loan is when a bank offers to lend money to consumers for a certain period. As a condition of bank loan, the borrower will need to pay a certain amount of interest per month or year. Loan prediction is one of the methods used by the bank to investigate their consumers are going to be the default (Charged Off) or not (Fully Paid).
Machine learning is a tool to make a bank loan prediction. With the classification method, we can predict the loan status of the consumers.
From this dataset, we can see that around 22.64% of consumers failed to pay the loan. Consumers who failed to pay will make a big loss to Bank as a lender.

In this project, I build a Machine Learning that can predict the future loan status of the consumers.
I compare 5 Machine Learning models to predict, such as :
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Ada Boost Classifier



Project Goals
-------------
The goal of the project is to reduce the risk of charged off loan status from consumers by making machine learning-based applications to determine the loan request based on the historical data.
